# NaW
Not another Wiki - A thumbdrive wiki made for single-user usage

Since there is a lot of good multi user wiki software around, this project tries to focus on cases where a single-user aggregates useful information from many different, often non-public accessible, places.  
When NaW's functionality has grown up to an useful state import/export from/to DokuWiki and MediaWiki is planned. This will probably cover vanilla functionality in first place.

NaW starts on 127.0.0.1:8081 which should generally restrict access to your computer (as long as you don't forward ports or accept remote logins of some kind or do other fancy network stuff. In other words: A traditional single-user workstation).  
Therefore user management or features requiring some kind of login or authentication are not planned for now.

Have a look at NaW's current [Roadmap](https://github.com/pyrox777/NaW/wiki/Roadmap).

:interrobang: NaW should have a proper licence declaration.
